Triplet Sum in Array (3sum):
==============================
Find a triplet that sums to a given value
Given an array arr[] of size n and an integer X. Find if thereâ€™s a triplet in the array which sums up to the given integer X.

Examples: 
Input: array = {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9}, sum = 24; 
Output: 12, 3, 9 
Explanation: There is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) present 
in the array whose sum is 24. 

Input: array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, sum = 9 
Output: 5, 3, 1 
Explanation: There is a triplet (5, 3 and 1) present 
in the array whose sum is 9.
